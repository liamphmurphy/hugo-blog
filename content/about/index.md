Hello there! My name is Liam Murphy, a software developer who (like many others) is interested in open-source, tech, and how software can be used to make our daily lives at least a little bit easier. If you would like to indulge my ego and read a bit more about me, below is some more information!

## Day Job

**Usual disclaimer: Everything expressed on this website is my own opinion; and not that of my employer(s).**

Currently I work as a Developer on the API Services team at [Gannett](https://www.gannett.com/), known for owning one of the most visited digital news websites, [USA TODAY](https://www.usatoday.com). As the team name implies, I spend most of my time working on the design and implementation of API's for internal use within the company; I work with GraphQL and REST. We're a Go shop (which happens to be my favorite language as of right now) and since this is my first job out of college, I'm still very much in "learning mode". 

## Personal

I currently reside in the beautiful Pacific Northwest city of Portland, Oregon. When I'm not coding, I try to spend my time exercising (and discovering the many hikes in my area), trying new breweries / taphouses with friends, failing to play a song on the guitar, reading a fantasy novel, or spending my free time learning about programming stuff even though I should probably take a break from that since I program for a living...
